<h1>Orbit Simulation (Unity)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This orbit simulation uses Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation to accurately (to a reasonable level) simulate the orbit of all of the planets in our solar system from a "top" down perspective in Unity 3D, as well as provide insightful facts and statistics about each orbital body.
